# Lesson 03: OrbitControls & Animation Loop

In this lesson, I learned how to:

- Use **OrbitControls** to navigate around the scene.
- Create a **continuous animation loop** for rendering.

### Key Concepts:

1. **OrbitControls**
   - Allows the user to **rotate, pan, and zoom** the camera using mouse or touch.
   - Example:
     ```js
     const controls = new OrbitControls(camera, renderer.domElement)
     ```
   - This attaches the controls to the camera and the DOM element of the renderer.
   - `controls.update()` ensures the camera updates every frame, especially if damping or smooth motion is used.

2. **requestAnimationFrame**
   - `requestAnimationFrame(animate)` tells the browser: *“Call this function before the next repaint”*.
   - It ensures smooth animation and optimal performance.

3. **Animation Loop**
   - We define an `animate()` function that:
     1. Requests the next frame
     2. Updates controls
     3. Renders the scene
   - This keeps the scene interactive and dynamic.

### Outcome:
- Four objects are displayed with unique colors and positions.
- Camera can now be moved interactively using mouse/touch.
