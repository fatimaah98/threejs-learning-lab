# Lesson 05 – Textures & Materials (Moon Surface)

In this lesson, the focus is on **textures** and how they dramatically improve realism in Three.js.

Instead of using flat colors, we apply multiple texture maps to a sphere to create a **moon-like surface** with visible details, depth, and light interaction.

## 🎯 What You Will Learn

* How to load textures using `TextureLoader`
* The difference between color, normal, and roughness maps
* Creating a realistic spherical object using textures

---

## 🧱 Textures Used

This lesson uses three main texture types:

### 1. Color Map (`map`)

Defines the base color of the surface.

### 2. Normal Map (`normalMap`)

Adds surface detail by simulating small bumps and dents without increasing geometry complexity.

### 3. Roughness Map (`roughnessMap`)

Controls how shiny or matte different areas of the surface are.

## 🧪 Material Setup

All textures are combined using `MeshStandardMaterial`, which reacts realistically to light:

```js
const moonMaterial = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({
  map: color,
  normalMap: normal,
  roughnessMap: roughness
})
```

## 📁 Notes

* All textures are loaded from the `/public/textures` directory
* Make sure textures are in **PNG or JPG** format for best compatibility
* This lesson demonstrates how textures are essential for realism in 3D scenes
