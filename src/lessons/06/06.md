# Lesson 06 – TextGeometry & 3D Text Rendering

In this lesson, the focus is on creating and rendering **3D text** in Three.js using `TextGeometry` and custom fonts.

The goal is to understand how text can become a real 3D object inside the scene and how it interacts with lighting, materials, and other meshes.

---

## 🎯 What You Will Learn

* How to load custom fonts using `FontLoader`
* How `TextGeometry` works in Three.js
* Converting text into a real 3D mesh
* Centering and positioning 3D text
* How lighting affects 3D text materials
* Attaching text to another object (parent-child relationship)

---

## 🔤 TextGeometry Basics

Three.js does not render text directly. Instead, text is converted into geometry using a font file (`.json`).

```js
const textGeometry = new TextGeometry('Hello World', {
  font,
  size: 0.2,
  depth: 0.1
})
```

### Important Properties:

* **font**: Loaded font data (required)
* **size**: Height of the text
* **depth**: Thickness of the text (extrusion)

---

## 📦 Font Loading

Fonts are loaded asynchronously using `FontLoader`:

```js
fontLoader.load('/fonts/Ubuntu_Bold.json', (font) => {
  // Create TextGeometry here
})
```

Only JSON fonts generated for Three.js can be used.

---

## 🎨 Text Material

The text uses `MeshStandardMaterial`, allowing it to react realistically to scene lighting:

```js
const textMaterial = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({
  color: 0xffffff,
  metalness: 0.7,
  roughness: 0.2
})
```

This gives the text a slightly metallic and polished appearance.

---

## 📐 Centering the Text

```js
textGeometry.center()
```

This ensures the text is centered around its origin, making positioning and alignment much easier.

---

## 🔗 Attaching Text to an Object

In this lesson, the text is added as a **child** of the sphere:

```js
sphere.add(textMesh)
```

This means:

* The text moves with the sphere
* Any transformation applied to the sphere also affects the text
