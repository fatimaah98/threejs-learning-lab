# Lesson 02: Basic Geometries and Materials

In this lesson, I learned how to create **basic 3D shapes (geometries)** in Three.js, apply **materials**, and position them in the scene.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Mesh**
   - A `Mesh` is an object in Three.js that **combines a geometry and a material**.
   - Geometry defines the **shape** (cube, sphere, cylinder, torus).
   - Material defines **how the surface looks** (color, texture, shading, etc.).
   - Example:
     ```js
     const cube = new THREE.Mesh(cubeGeometry, redMaterial)
     ```

2. **Materials**
   - Materials define the appearance of a 3D object.
   - `MeshBasicMaterial` is a simple material that shows **flat colors** and is **not affected by lights**.
   - We used different materials for each shape:
     - Red cube
     - Gray sphere
     - Pink cylinder
     - Green torus

3. **Positioning**
   - By default, all objects are created at the origin `(0, 0, 0)`.
   - To avoid overlapping, we set positions:
     - `sphere.position.x = 3` → moves the sphere 3 units to the right
     - `cylinder.position.x = -3` → moves the cylinder 3 units to the left
     - `torus.position.y = 3` → moves the torus 3 units up
   - This creates a **clear and organized layout** in the scene.

### Outcome:
- Successfully added four different geometries to the scene.
- Each shape has a unique material and position.
