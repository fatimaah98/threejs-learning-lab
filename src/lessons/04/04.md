# Lesson 04: Rotation, Grid Helper, Lights & Materials

In this lesson, I explored animation basics, scene helpers, different types of lights, and multiple material types in Three.js.

---

## 🎯 What I Learned

- How to rotate objects using the animation loop
- How `GridHelper` helps visualize the 3D space
- Different types of lights and their helpers
- Differences between common mesh materials and how they react to light

---

## 🔄 Object Rotation

Objects in Three.js can be rotated on three axes: `x`, `y`, and `z`.

```js
cube.rotation.x += 0.05
```
- This rotates the cube continuously on the X axis.

- Rotation values are measured in radians.

- Placing this inside the animation loop creates smooth motion.

## 🧭 GridHelper

a visual helper that displays a grid on the scene
``GridHelper(size, divisions)``

```js
const grid = new THREE.GridHelper(10, 10)
```
### Why it's useful?
1. **Helps understand object positions and distances**
2. **Makes spatial orientation easier while learning**
3. **Acts like a 3D reference plane**

## 💡 Lights
- AmbientLight: **``Provides uniform light without direction and shadow to prevent scenes from being completely dark``**
    - Properties: **AmbientLight(color, intensity)**
- PointLight: **``Emits light from a single point, Similar to a light bulb``**
    - Properties: **PointLight(color, intensity, distance)**
- DirectionalLight: **``Emits light in a specific direction, Similar to sunlight``**
    - Properties: **DirectionalLight(color, intensity)**

## 🎨 Materials
Materials define how objects react to light.
### MeshBasicMaterial:
1. Does not reac to lights
2. Always fully visible
3. Useful for debugging or wireframes

### MeshLambertMaterial:
1. Reacts to light
2. Lightweight and simple

### MeshPhongMaterial:
1. Supports shiny highlights

### MeshStandardMaterial:
1. Physically based

### MeshPhysicalMaterial:
1. Advanced version of Standard material
2. Used for glass-like or transparent objects
